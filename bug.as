This ActionScript 3 code attempts to access a property of a null object. This often happens when an object is expected to be initialized or loaded before a dependent operation attempts to access it.  For example, if a variable `myObject` is used before its value is set, then this error may appear.  Another common cause is asynchronous operations like loading data from an external source, where the data might not be available immediately when the code tries to use it.

```actionscript
// Example of accessing a property of a null object
var myObject:Object = null;
trace(myObject.someProperty); // Error: Null object reference

// Example in an event handler where data might not be loaded yet
private function onDataLoaded(event:Event):void {
  // Assuming 'myData' is loaded asynchronously
  trace(myData.value); // Error may occur if myData is still null
}
```
